# Kernel Keyboard Routines

The kernel provides several routines for interfacing with the keyboard.

*Note*: An include file is provided in
[inc/keys.inc](https://github.com/KnightSoft/KnightOS/blob/master/inc/keys.inc) that
includes all key codes used by the kernel.

* [flushKeys](#flushkeys)
* [getKey](#getkey)
* [waitKey](#waitkey)

The code for these routines may be found in
[src/kernel/00/keyboard.asm](https://github.com/KnightSoft/KnightOS/blob/master/src/kernel/00/keyboard.asm).
